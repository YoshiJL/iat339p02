        <img src="img/reading.png" alt="Reading">
        <p>The Kumon Reading Program is designed to build the critical reading skills that will help your child develop a lifelong love of reading – and a solid foundation for academic success. Daily Reading Worksheets will take about 30 minutes to complete – in two sessions a week at a Kumon Centre, and another five assignments completed at home. Your child will work at his or her own pace, mastering each new reading concept before moving on. With each worksheet, your child’s overall reading and writing skills will advance incrementally.</p>
