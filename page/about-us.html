          <h4>Kumon was created by a dad, who wanted the best for his son</h4>
          <p>In 1954 Japan, a father and gifted math teacher, named Toru Kumon wanted his young son, Takeshi, to develop a love for learning. He also wanted him to be thoroughly prepared for rigorous high school and college entrance exams in his future.</p>

          <h4>Short, incremental assignments helped his son to master concepts</h4>
          <p>Each day, Toru gave Takeshi short, incremental assignments to complete, allowing his son to master each concept completely before learning a new skill. The method was so successful that by sixth grade, Takeshi was solving calculus problems.</p>

          <h4>Toru’s son started studying far beyond grade-level</h4>
          <p>As young Takeshi Kumon’s ability improved, other parents took notice and their interest in Toru Kumon’s unique step-by-step self-learning method grew. Today, Kumon has helped millions of students in 50 countries.</p>
