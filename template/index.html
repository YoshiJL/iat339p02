      <section class="size1of3">
        <h4>Kumon was created by a dad, who wanted the best for his son</h4>
        <p>In 1954 Japan, a father and gifted math teacher, named Toru Kumon wanted his young son, Takeshi, to develop a love for learning. He also wanted him to be thoroughly prepared for rigorous high school and college entrance exams in his future.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="size1of3">
        <h4>Short, incremental assignments helped his son to master concepts</h4>
        <p>Each day, Toru gave Takeshi short, incremental assignments to complete, allowing his son to master each concept completely before learning a new skill. The method was so successful that by sixth grade, Takeshi was solving calculus problems.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="size1of3">
        <h4>Toru’s son started studying far beyond grade-level</h4>
        <p>As young Takeshi Kumon’s ability improved, other parents took notice and their interest in Toru Kumon’s unique step-by-step self-learning method grew. Today, Kumon has helped millions of students in 50 countries.</p>

      <h3>Why Kumon?</h3>
      <p>Kumon allows atudents to work independently and at their own pace, we feel it's very important the develop the confidence in students into becoming self learners</p>
      <p>It is important for a child to become self-reliant and self-confident and Kumon programs can help the child reach that goal</p>
      <p>Each student has a unique lesson plan customized to his ability developed by the instructor. The goal is to have everything to be individualized for the student so that there is no gap in his learning</p>
      <p>Correcting errors is very important in Kumon. We really want the students to able to identify any of their mistakes because that helps to contribute to how well they will master the concept. There will be times when the student feels like they are struggling or things are getting too hard but actually that's the point when most of our parents realize Kumon is actually working for them and that they're really being pushed to their full potential.</p>

      <h3>The Kumon Worksheets are the key to your child’s success</h3>
      <p>You’ll find that Kumon is different from passive learning programs. Instead of taking notes, memorizing facts, and being fed information from teachers or a tutor, your child actively develops critical, self-learning skills. Kumon accomplishes this through: <strong>examples that demonstrate</strong> and <strong>carefully designed worksheets</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
      <h3>How does Kumon work day-to-day?</h3>
      <p>Your child's daily assignment take about 30 minutes per subject to complete.</p>
      <p>Two days a week your child completes assignments at a Kumon centre; the other five assignments are completed at home.</p>
